# Predicting authors of famous paintings

In this project, I experimented with several deep learning models to predict artist of paintings. I used [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time) of 8,000+ paintings by 50 famous artists from Kaggle to train the model.

The code and the description of the project workflow is available in the artist_prediction.ipynb notebook.

The resulting machine learning demo that attempts to recognize authors of famous paintings is available on Hugging Face Saces [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/osydorchuk/painting_authors). Given the dataset limitations, the model only recognizes paintings of 50 artists.

The post on Medium outlining key results of the project is available [here](https://medium.com/@oleksii.sydorchuk/building-my-first-book-recommender-engine-results-and-lessons-learned-4aad48d29f00).
